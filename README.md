The GIPHY API is used to make this dynamic web page that populates with gifs of the user choice. JavaScript and jQuery were used to change the HTML of this site.

Users can click on the different marine animal buttons to get their images. When clicked the images turn into gifs which changes back into images when clicked again.

The user can also provide input in the search section to recieve relative images from GIPHY API and their gifs by clicking on the images.
